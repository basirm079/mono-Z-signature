For mono-Z signature, we need 2HDM+a psuedoscalar model which could be downloaded using the link below
https://github.com/LHC-DMWG/model-repository/tree/DMSimp_t/models
Save the model's directory in heptools/models
For signal generation, we import the 2HDM+a psuedoscalar model by using the following command in Madgraph:
>>import model Pseudoscalar_2HDM
For signal generation(g-g fusion):
>>generate g g > l+ l- xd xd~ /h1[QCD=noborn]
where, [QCD=noborn] means that you claim that the process does not have any tree-level amplitude. 
Which allows to use loop-induced mode (note that we do not check if a tree-level exists and result are likely non physical if a tree level amplitude 
does exists).
For backgrounds, we are using Standard model.we are considering WW, ZZ, tt~ and Z+jets.
for tt~
>>generate p p > t t~, (t > w+ b, w+ > l+ vl), (t~ > w- b~, w- > l- vl~)
for WW
>>generate p p > w+ w-, w+ > l+ vl, w- > l- vl~
for ZZ
>>generate p p > z z, z > l+ l-, z > vl vl~
for z+jets(here we are consider two jets where j=b b~)
>>generate p p > z j j , z > l+ l-(for cases like delta_R or delta_phi)
>>generate p p > z j j , z > vl vl~(for plotting variables that require missing energy or momentum)
where one could add W+jets and WZ backgrounds but they are not strong backrounds.
